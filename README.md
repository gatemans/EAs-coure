# Evolutionary Algorithms for Optimization (GA, PSO, and More)

This repository contains **educational MATLAB implementations of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)** developed as part of my *Optimization* course. The main goal is not just to provide working code, but to **clearly explain the structure, logic, and key parameters** of popular metaheuristic algorithms such as **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**.

The repository is suitable for:

* Students learning optimization and metaheuristics
* Researchers who want clean, readable reference implementations
* Anyone who wants to understand *how* and *why* these algorithms work, not just run them

## 🧬 Genetic Algorithm (GA) – MATLAB Implementation

### 1. Basic Idea

The Genetic Algorithm is inspired by **biological evolution**. A population of candidate solutions evolves over generations using operators such as **selection**, **crossover**, and **mutation**.

At each generation:

1. Better solutions have a higher chance to survive
2. New solutions are created by combining existing ones
3. Random mutations help maintain diversity

---

### 2. GA Algorithm Structure

```
Initialize population
Evaluate fitness
while termination condition not met:
    Select parents
    Apply crossover
    Apply mutation
    Evaluate offspring
    Form new population
end
Return best solution
```

This structure is directly reflected in the MATLAB code organization, where each operator is implemented as a separate `.m` function.

### 3. Main GA Parameters

| Parameter           | Description               | Typical Values       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Population Size (N) | Number of individuals     | 20 – 200             |
| Max Generations     | Stopping criterion        | 50 – 1000            |
| Crossover Rate (Pc) | Probability of crossover  | 0.6 – 0.9            |
| Mutation Rate (Pm)  | Probability of mutation   | 0.001 – 0.1          |
| Selection Method    | Parent selection strategy | Roulette, Tournament |
| Encoding            | Solution representation   | Binary / Real-valued |

### 4. Strengths & Weaknesses

**Advantages**

* Global search capability
* Works with non-differentiable functions
* Highly flexible

**Disadvantages**

* Can be slow to converge
* Parameter tuning is critical
* May lose diversity without proper mutation

## 🐦 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) – MATLAB Implementation

### 1. Basic Idea

PSO is inspired by **social behavior** of birds or fish. Each particle represents a candidate solution and moves through the search space based on:

* Its own experience (personal best)
* The experience of the swarm (global best)

Unlike GA, PSO does **not** use crossover or mutation.

---

### 2. PSO Algorithm Structure

```
Initialize particles (position & velocity)
Evaluate fitness
Update personal bests
Update global best
while termination condition not met:
    Update velocities
    Update positions
    Evaluate fitness
    Update personal & global bests
end
Return global best solution
```

---

### 3. Velocity Update Equation

```
v = w*v + c1*r1*(pbest - x) + c2*r2*(gbest - x)
x = x + v
```

Where:

* `w` : inertia weight
* `c1` : cognitive coefficient
* `c2` : social coefficient
* `r1, r2` : random numbers in [0,1]

---

### 4. Main PSO Parameters

| Parameter          | Description                      | Typical Values    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Swarm Size         | Number of particles              | 20 – 100          |
| Inertia Weight (w) | Balance exploration/exploitation | 0.4 – 0.9         |
| c1 (Cognitive)     | Self-confidence                  | ~1.5 – 2          |
| c2 (Social)        | Swarm confidence                 | ~1.5 – 2          |
| Velocity Limits    | Prevent explosion                | Problem-dependent |
| Max Iterations     | Stopping criterion               | 100 – 1000        |
